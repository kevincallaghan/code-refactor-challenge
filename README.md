# Code Refactor Challenge

## Description

For the first challenge of the Coding Bootcamp, our project was designed to refactor an existing website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.  This project was build to learn the Semantic HTML Elements and to detect CSS that can be combined in order to have a clean CSS Style Sheet.  It was also an introduction in pushing and pulling a repository to Github from my local terminal.  By learning Semantic HTML and Combining CSS, it aids in website accessibility and also makes the code better for anyone else who may need to work with it in the future.  By completing this project, I became comfortable using the terminal to interact with Github and I gained exposure to the idea of naming div's in a manner in which the element name will semantically describe the area of html included in that part of the code.  I also became more comfortable with the CSS Stylesheets.
